🚀 Simplifying Error Handling in React with Axios Interceptors
I’ve implemented an Axios Interceptor to handle errors globally across the application. 
This ensures that all API errors are caught in one place, making the code cleaner, more maintainable, and user-friendly. 
Here’s how it works:

⏳ Global Error Handling:
All API errors (e.g., 400, 401, 404, 500) are intercepted and handled in a single place.
Users see meaningful error messages, and developers get detailed logs for debugging.

✅ Toast Notifications:
Errors are displayed to users using React Toastify, ensuring a smooth user experience.

✅ Reusable Code:
The interceptor is reusable across the entire application, reducing code duplication.

✅ Key Features of the Blog Application:
Frontend: React with hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks like useFetch).
Backend: Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.
Error Handling: Centralized error handling with Axios Interceptors.
Responsive Design: Built with Tailwind CSS for a clean and modern UI.

⚡ Why This Matters
Better User Experience: Users get clear and actionable error messages.
Cleaner Code: Developers can focus on building features instead of handling errors everywhere.
Scalability: The interceptor makes it easy to add new error-handling logic in the future.
