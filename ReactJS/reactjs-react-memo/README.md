### ** Optimize Re-renders Using `React.memo`**  

Are you looking to improve the performance of your React applications? Let’s talk about React.memo! 🚀

**What is `React.memo`?**  
`React.memo` is a **higher-order component** that helps optimize performance by **preventing unnecessary re-renders** of functional components. It **memoizes** the rendered output and only re-renders if the component’s **props change**.

---

### **🛠 Practical Example**

Let's say you have a `ChildComponent` that receives props from a parent. Without `React.memo`, the `ChildComponent` would re-render **every time** the parent re-renders, even if the props haven't changed.  

By wrapping it with `React.memo`, the component will **only re-render when its props actually change**.

---

### **📄 Code Example**

**App.jsx**  
```jsx
import React, { useState } from 'react';
import MyComponent from './MyComponent';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mainul');

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>App Component</h1>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment Count</button>
      <button onClick={() => setName(name === 'Mainul' ? 'Hasan' : 'Mainul')}>
        Change Name
      </button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>

      // My Component render if name changes
      <MyComponent name={name} />
    </div>
  );
}

export default AppComponent;
```

---

**MyComponent.jsx**  
```jsx
import React from 'react';


const MyComponent = React.memo(({ name }) => {
  console.log('ChildComponent rendered');
  return <h2>My Component - Name: {name}</h2>;
});

export default MyComponent;
```

---

### **🔍 What Happens Here?**
1. **Incrementing the Count**:  
   Clicking the **"Increment Count"** button causes the parent to re-render, but **ChildComponent won't re-render** because the `name` prop hasn't changed.

2. **Changing the Name**:  
   Clicking the **"Change Name"** button will **trigger a re-render** of the `ChildComponent` since the `name` prop changes.
---

### **🎯 Benefits of `React.memo`**
- **Prevents unnecessary re-renders**, improving performance in complex UIs.
- Ideal for **pure functional components** that rely solely on props.
- Enhances efficiency in apps with **large component trees**.
---

### Pro Tip

Use React.memo wisely! Overusing it can lead to unnecessary complexity. It’s most effective when applied to components that:

1. Render frequently.
2. Receive the same props most of the time.
3. Are part of a large component tree.
